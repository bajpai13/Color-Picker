# Color-Picker

This a color picker chrome extension. I have used HTML, CSS and JS.

This not only picks color but can also export the history of colors picked by you.

This is a simple extension. It contains a very simple interface. 

### The files are - 

- index.html - It contains all the simple HTML of the extension.

- style.css - It contains the styling part of the extension.

- index.js - It contains the javascript part. The functioning of the extension.

- manifest.json - Every extension requires a JSON-formatted file, that provides important information.
